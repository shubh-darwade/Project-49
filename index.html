<h2>This are some of the Orgami's.</h2>
<a href="https://origami.me/elephant/"><img src="elephant.png" alt="elephant Orgami" height="500" width="500"></a>
    <li>Elephants need up to 150kg of food per day – that's around 375 tins of baked beans although half of this may leave the body undigested. They eat so much that they can spend up to three-quarters of their day eating.</li>
    <li>Elephants communicate in a variety of ways - including sounds like trumpet calls (some sounds are too low for people to hear), body language, touch and scent. They can also communicate through seismic signals - sounds that create vibrations in the ground - which they may detect through their bones.</li>
<li>Amazingly, elephant calves are able to stand within 20 minutes of being born and can walk within 1 hour. After two days, they can keep up with the herd. This incredible survival technique means that herds of elephants can keep migrating to find food and water to thrive.</li>

  <li> Cows can sleep while they’re standing</li> 
  <li> Cows spend about 10 hours a day lying down.</li>

  <li>Camels are very strong and can carry up to 900 pounds for 25 miles a day.</li>
  <li>Camels can travel at up to 40 miles per hour – the same as a racehorse!</li>

  <a href="https://origami.me/sheep/"><img src="sheep.png" alt="sheep Orgami" height="500" width="500"></a>
